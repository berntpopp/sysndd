[["index.html", "The SysNDD Documentation Preface History of SysID and SysNDD The SysNDD concept Acknowledgments", " The SysNDD Documentation Bernt Popp, Christiane Zweier 2022-06-08 Preface This documentation is intended to describe the SysNDD project and provide instructions for regular usershow to use the too and for curator status users how to perform reviews and how to enter data. History of SysID and SysNDD SysNDD is based on its predecessor SysID which had been published in 2016 (Kochinke et al. 2016). Christiane Zweier has been involved in establishing and updating SysID from its start in 2009. She has since performed and coordinated curation and regular updates. The PHP based SysID web tool (Yii 2 framework) was however not further developed and maintained besides necessary bugfixes. After the maintenance agreement for the original server at the CMBI at Radboud University in Nijmegen ran out, the installation was moved to a virtual server at the Department for BioMedical Research (DBMR) at the University Bern. The former link from the initial publication is re-directed so it still works. The legacy code base was updated to allow installation and security fixes and to be uploaded to a GitHub repository (SysID). In 2019 the chance arose to integrate the SysID curation effort with the Orphanet resource, supported by ERN ITHACA. In the process of aligning the curation and naming conventions for genes, diseases and phenotypes we decided to redesign the database and web tool. The SysNDD concept SysNDD contains a manually curated catalogue of published gene-disease-associations implicated in neurodevelopmental disorders (NDD). To allow interoperability and mapping between gene-, phenotype- or disease-oriented databases, we center our approach around curated gene-inheritance-disease units, so called entities. These entities are classified into different confidence status (categories: Definitive, Moderate, Limited, Refuted) according to the degree of underlying scientific evidence. Furthermore, manually curated information on associated phenotypes is provided. The entries in SysNDD are currently updated every 3-4 months and can be utilized for a broad spectrum of tasks from both research and diagnostics. One of our goals is to incorporate the SysNDD data into other gene/ disease-relationship databases like the Orphanet ontology (first results: id-genes.orphanet.app). Bernt Popp (scientist at the Institute of Human Genetics at the University Hospital Leipzig, Germany) developed and programmed the SysNDD tool and will be integrating further functionality including variants associated with entities in future updates.

However, there are many unique causes of rare diseases, thus many individuals are affected by such a disease. Due to the rarity of each single entity, effective management, surveillance and treatment is challenging So is finding the correct diagnosis, which is often described as the diagnostic odyssey. Rare diseases often have a genetic cause, making high-throughput sequencing (next-generations sequencing; NGS) a central part of finding the molecular diagnosis. 1.1 Neurodevelopmental disorders Neurodevelopmental disorders (NDD) affect about 2% of children. They represent a clinically and genetically extremely heterogeneous disease group comprising amongst other developmental delay (DD), intellectual disability (ID) and autism spectrum disorder (ASD) and developmental and epileptic encephalopathies (DEE). 1.2 Genetic heterogeneity The huge genetic heterogeneity is evident when looking at the published gene-disease associations over time. Thus the question arises: How can we keep track of this fast development and have the information at hand when we need it in the clinic or when analyzing sequencing data? While the answer to this question is easy: We need curated databases to catalogue and summarize the wealth of published information. The task at hand is not only laborious but also requires expertise and consistence. 1.3 Expert curation In our opinion, the curation of gene-disease relationships in rare disease such as NDDs requires clinical and scientific proficiency in the respective field. This implies that clinician scientists involved in counseling, diagnostics, and research of NDD are predestined for this task. To reduce workload and dependence on single experts, a distributed effort in larger consortia and collaboration between different work groups is needed. In the course of updating SysID we had the great chance to contribute our data to Orphanet to create a European ID/NDD specific reference list. With support from the ITHACA Workgroup: intellectual disability (id-genes.orphanet.app) in 2019 we started working with the Orphanet team which is part of the Gene Curation Coalition (GenCC). Additionally, we are able to recruit expert curators from ERN ITHACA to contribute to re-curation of old data and updating new data in SysNDD. 1.4 Technical concepts In addition to a pool of experts, the right tools are needed. We defined gene-inheritance-disease units as entities which represent the central curation effort. The components of these entities are normalized using widely used and standardized ontology terms (e.g. HGNC identifier for genes, OMIM or MONDO for disease and inheritance from HPO). This allows interoperability and linking to other data sources. Based on this concept we developed a new database scheme, which allows entities to be systematically and reproducibly cataloged. The database is abstracted into a JSON API, which allows structured programmatic access to the underlying data. Finally, the API feeds the web tool which can be used to easily search, filter, download and visualize the database contents in modern webbrowsers. 1.5 Outlook The SysNDD database will improve the understanding and curation of rare NDD entities. SysNDD will enable systems biology and network analyses. Our long-term goal is incorporation of the high-quality, manually curated SysNDD data into European and international gene disease relationship databases, thus, improving diagnostics and care for individuals with rare NDDs.

The web tool uses the Vue.js (v2.6) JavaScript framework with BootstrapVue to generate a Bootstrap v4 website frontend. 2.1 Landing page The landing page is designed as simple Bootstrap v4 website with: a navigation menu at the top, the main site content, which changes with navigation to other routes, and a footer navigation bar at the bottom Screenshot of the landing page with elements marked: Landing page The landing page content displays different elemnts to give a quick overview and allow fast navigation: a centered search input at the top, a box (left side top) with current gene statistics divided by association category and inheritance patterns (Details), a box (left side bottom) showing a table of the 5 last entities entered into the database, an explanatory text on the right. 2.2 Main navigation menu The main navigation allows quick access to all subpages. The Tables button triggers a dropwdown menu with links to: - Entities table view - Genes table view - Phenotypes table view - Panels table view Navigation menu tables The Analyses button triggers a dropwdown menu with links to: - Compare curations view - Correlate phenotypes view - Entries over time view - NDD Publications view - Gene networks view Navigation menu analyses If not on the landing page the navigation abr also conatins a Search button which can show a search field on any page. Navigation menu search If not logged in the right side of the menu shows a button which directs to the Login page. When logged in as a registered user the menu shows your username and additional links to page views depending on your user rights: Navigation menu login 2.3 Footer navigation menu The footer navigation shows pictures/ logos with links to: the license applied to SysNDD our GitHub repository the SysNDD API view the DFG funder website the website of teh University of Bern hosting our server the ERN-ITHACA website Footer navigation 2.4 Table views We provide tabular representations with search, filtering, sorting and pagination functionality for different aspects of the entity concept. 2.4.1 Entities table The Entities table is intended to provide an overview centered on the entity concept. Entities view 2.4.2 Genes table The Genes table is intended to provide gene centered overview. Genes view 2.4.3 Phenotypes table The Phenotypes table provides the possibility to filter for phenotype combinations annotated to the entities. Phenotypes view The AND/ OR switch allows the user to change the logik how phenotype combinations are requested: AND: only entities having all selected phenoytpes annotated are shown. OR: all entities having any of the selected phenoytpes annotated are shown. 2.4.4 Panels table The Panels table is intended for users to be able to create lists of NDD-associated genes. Additionally, the columns in the lists can be configured. Finally, the configuration can be downloaded as Excel file with information on the exact query in the meta sheet and the requested information in the data sheet. These files can then be used as virtual panels to filter genetic variants derived from high-throughput sequencing in external analysis tools.

Reset modal Upon submission the E-mail account will receive a message with a one-time link allowing the user to enter a new password. 2.8.3 Mobile website The Vue.js framework enables native cross platform development. Together with the Bootstrap CSS library this enables the SysNDD web app to seamlessly integrate on smaller mobile screens. Mobile site The layout breaks to mobile view at 768 pixels width and minimizes the navigation and footer menus: Mobile navbar Mobile footer All tables in mobile views break to a stacked view (column names becoem first column in a cell and values second column) to best use display space: Stacked table The table controls and search inputs are further dispalyed at the top in this view. The analyses pages on mobile pages are best viewed in landscape mode: Landscape mode 2.8.4 Progressive Web App (PWA) The SysNDD web app can also be installed on mobile devices using the Progressive Web App (PWA) technology. This is supported in all Chromium-based modern browsers (Chrome, Edge, Opera, etc.) on all common operating systems (Windows, Linux, maxOS and Android). Additionally new Safari versions on iOS show some support for PWA. PWAs are faster because they cache files. They offer more screen space for the app. Future integrations of this feature in SysNDD will enable offline use. To install the PWA on Android devices follow these steps: 1) Visit the SysNDD website at https://sysndd.dbmr.unibe.ch/. You will see a message offering to add the PWA to your home screen: PWA add 2) After clicking the previous message, confirm the installation by clicking Install in the following prompt: PWA install 3) A message will confirm the installation: PWA added 4) Following app symbol will be available on one of your screens: App symbol 5) Clicking this will open SysNDD in PWA mode (no browser adress bar, instead custom colored top bar): PWA screenshot 2.8.5 Performance Modern Javascript frameworks like Vue.js, which we use for the SysNDD website, offer rich user experience. The generated single-page applications can be slower then server side rendered pages. With SysNDD we are engaged to provide a fast user experience by reducing component and request sizes and applying techniques like lazy loading and code splitting in the frontend with parallelisation in the api. A quick overview on the current website performance can be obtained on PageSpeed Insights (or Lighthouse in the chrome development console): https://pagespeed.web.dev/report?url=https%3A%2F%2Fsysndd.dbmr.unibe.ch%2F 2.8.6 Security SysNDD is engaged to offer highest security standards for all web tools. We use HTTPS with Transport Layer Security (TLS) and follow the mozilla recommendations for web server settings. A quick overview for our security settings for the SysNDD website can be obtained on Mozilla Oservatory: https://observatory.mozilla.org/analyze/sysndd.dbmr.unibe.ch "],["api.html", "Chapter | 3 API", " Chapter | 3 API The SysNDD api (application programming interface) is available from https://sysndd.dbmr.unibe.ch/API. The api is written in R using the plumber package. We intend to follow the Swagger/ OpenAPI and JSON:API specifications. The api scripts run in a Docker container using the official rocker/tidyverse image (version 4.2.0). As R is single threaded, we deploy multiple instances of the api container. These are bundled together using HAProxy load balancer. The api is rate limited through our NGINX web server configuration with a rate limit of 10 requests per second (10r/s; equals 1 request every 100 milliseconds) per requesting ip. The configuration allows bursts of up to 30r/s but introduces a delay after 10 requests to enforce the rate limit. 3.0.1 Endpoints The SysNDD api currently contains all endpoints for externala nd internal usage in one api script. This may change with future releases. The api is structured into different components based on the SysND concept: entity: Entity related endpoints review: Reviews related endpoints status: Status related endpoints re_review: Re-review related endpoints publication: Publication related endpoints gene: Gene related endpoints ontology: Ontology related endpoints inheritance: Inheritance related endpoints phenotype: Phenoptype related endpoints panels: Gene panel related endpoints comparisons: NDD gene list comparisons related endpoints search: Database search related endpoints list: Database list related endpoints statistics: Database statistics user: User account related endpoints authentication: Authentication related endpoints The endpoints are documented and can be tested using the Swagger/ OpenAPI user interface at https://sysndd.dbmr.unibe.ch/API. Here one can generate cURL requests to use in external software. 3.0.2 Usage policy The SysNDD api powers the web tool for everyday users. We also provide the SysNDD api free to allow users to use the SysNDD data and build on it by creating software or services that connect to our platform. Usage requirements: - optimize your requests to stay in the above described limits - be sensible about re-using data (e.g., store your requests until data is updated on our server) - use pagination where possible instead of requesting large data chunks (e.g., restrict usage of all option in large, potentially blocking list endpoints like entity and gene) - if you require more api ressources please get in contact Updates and disclaimer: - We provide the SysNDD api as-is. - Due to the current development status (version 0.X.Y) we may update or modify the api any time. These changes may affect your use of the api or the way your integration interacts with the api. 3.0.3 Authentication and authorization The SysNDD api uses JSON Web Tokens (JWT) to implement stateless authentication and authorization. The api user can manually (test purposes) request a token by entering their login credentials in the ionput form provided at the api/auth/authenticate endpoint: Authenticate endpoint This endpoint will generate and respond with and JWT token: JWT token This Bearer token can then be copied and entered in the OpenAPI/ Swagger authorize modal which opens after clicking the Authorize modal button at the upper right corner: Authorize button Authorize modal prompt After entereing the token in the respective field (1) and cklicking the Authorize submission button the modal will change and show the login status. This field can be closed now: Authorize modal logged in The user is now fully authenticated and can access the endpoints requiring user rights: API logged in The token is valid for 60 minutes. It can be refreshed using the endpoint api/auth/refresh.

Publication required (no grey literature like conference abstracts or personal communication; manuscripts on preprint servers can be considered individually but only entered through their DOI in the comment field until published with PMID, when they should be updated) AND 2. Clear-cut frequency (no further criteria needed) &gt;= 10 cases with de novo variants &gt;= 5 autosomal-recessive families &gt;= 3 families with X-chromosomal variants OR 3.

Age of first publication(s) without further confirmatory reports in the meantime Publication quality and journal or genetics expertise doubtful New evidence against gene and/or variants: e.g., constraint scores, frequencies in gnomAD 5.3 NDD Moderate and Limited entities These categories include the previous category of candidate genes and are now split into criteria for entity categories 2 (Moderate) and 3 (Limited): 1. Must be published (no private, in-house candidate lists) AND 2. ID indicated, but criteria not sufficient for category 1, examples: a. Limited genetic evidence &lt; 3 cases with de novo, different variants and non-specific NDD phenotype 1 recessive family with truncating variant or &lt;= 2 recessive families with missense variants (category 2 or 3 depending on number of affected and tested individuals per family, functional evidence and homogeneity of phenotype etc.) candidate gene from translocation or larger deletion reports of enzymatically confirmed patients with specific metabolic disorders but without genetic mutation confirmed b. Limited clinical evidence not much evidence for ID, e.g. reported as ADHD or ASD or neurological disorder without clearly reported low IQ and ID known disorder, but only single patients reported with ID motor developmental delay without evidence for cognitive impairment clear neurodegenerative course without ID or cognitive delay present in the first years lethal before ID might be evident, although e.g. brain malformations or metabolic abnormalities might point to ID ID reported in other, similar disorders caused by mutations in the same pathway/complex but not (yet) in association with this particular gene (e.g. Fanconi anemia) c. Limited combined genetic and clinical evidence Gene enriched for de novo or rare deleterious variants in large NDD cohorts or meta-studies, no further details 5.3.1 Exclusion criteria Published as candidate gene only based on function or experimental results but without variants reported in humans AND/OR Only 1 de novo case from longer ago without further evidence and gene tolerant towards missense and/or loss-of-function variants according to gnomAD constraint scores AND/OR Only 1 sporadic case with bi-allelic variants and without any further supporting evidence such as segregation in other family members, functional tests, similar phenotypes in other patients with variants in genes from the same pathway, etc. 5.3.2 When to choose category 2 (Moderate)? Too good for category 3 (Limited) but not good enough for category 1 (Definitive) Examples: Recurrent de novo variant in 2 individuals with a similar phenotype Bi-allelic or X-chromosomal truncating variant segregating in &gt;= two generations of a large family Convincing functional evidence 1-2 patients with convincing variants in a gene which is in the same complex/pathway with other known disease genes and phenotype fits (e.g. CDG syndrome) 5.3.3 Special case: non-NDD entities Some genes are associated with multiple entities. Among these entities there might be some without ID as a clinical feature. These non-NDD entities will be included in SysNDD but they will not be classified to any of the categories. Instead, they are tagged with n.a. (not applicable).
