The web tool uses the Vue.js (v2.6) JavaScript framework with BootstrapVue to generate a Bootstrap v4 website frontend. 2.1 Landing page The landing page is designed as simple Bootstrap v4 website with: a navigation menu at the top, the main site content, which changes with navigation to other routes, and a footer navigation bar at the bottom Screenshot of the landing page with elements marked: Landing page The landing page content displays different elements to give a quick overview and allow fast navigation: a centered search input at the top, a box (left side top) with current gene statistics divided by association category and inheritance patterns (Details), a box (left side bottom) showing a table of the five last entities entered into the database, an explanatory text on the right. 2.2 Main navigation menu The main navigation allows quick access to all sub-pages. The Tables button triggers a dropdown menu with links to: Entities table view Genes table view Phenotypes table view Panels table view Navigation menu: Tables The Analyses button triggers a dropdown menu with links to: Compare curations view Correlate phenotypes view Entries over time view NDD Publications view Functional clusters view Navigation menu: Analyses The About button directs you to further information on: SysNDD and its creators Citation Policy Support and Funding News and Updates Credits and acknowledgement Help and FAQ Disclaimer Contact Navigation menu: About If not on the landing page, a search bar also appears on the navigation menu. Navigation menu: search bar If not logged in, the right side of the menu shows a button which directs you to the Login page. When logged in as a registered user the menu shows your username and additional links to page views depending on your user rights: Navigation menu: Login 2.3 Footer navigation menu The footer navigation shows logos with links to: the license applied to SysNDD our GitHub repository the SysNDD API view the DFG funder website the website of the University of Bern hosting our server the ERN-ITHACA website Footer navigation 2.4 Table views We provide tabular representations with search, filtering, sorting and pagination functionality for different aspects of the entity concept. 2.4.1 Entities table The Entities table is intended to provide an overview centered on the entity concept. Entities view 2.4.2 Genes table The Genes table is intended to provide a gene-centered overview. Genes view 2.4.3 Phenotypes table The Phenotypes table provides the possibility to filter for phenotype combinations annotated to the entities. Phenotypes view The ‘AND/ OR’ switch allows the user to change the logic how phenotype combinations are requested: AND: only entities having all selected phenotypes annotated are shown OR: all entities having any of the selected phenotypes annotated are shown The Entities, Genes and Phenotypes tables all have the additional two features (top right corner): Green icon that allows the user to copy the link to the page Yellow icon that allows the use to remove all filters on the table (icon turns blue when all filters are off) Entities, Genes and Phenotypes tables - additional features 2.4.4 Panels table The Panels table is intended for users to be able to create lists of NDD-associated genes. Additionally, the columns in the lists can be configured. Finally, the configuration can be downloaded as an Excel file with information on the exact query in the meta sheet and the requested information in the data sheet. These files can then be used as ‘virtual panels’ to filter genetic variants derived from high-throughput sequencing in external analysis tools. Panels view 2.5 Single entry pages Single entry pages refer to the directed pages associated with each entity, gene or disease ontology. These are accessed clicking on the entity (purple), gene (orange) or disease (green) buttons associated with each entry. Single entry pages 2.5.1 Entity The Entity page aims to provide information on the gene, disease (with the OMIM link), inheritance pattern and NDD status associated with a particular entity. The synopsis and phenotypes of the disease as well as the relevant links to publications (including GeneReviews if available) are also provided. Entity page 2.5.2 Gene The Gene page aims to provide further information on 1) the gene of interest with links to other platforms such as Entrez, Ensembl, UCSC, CCDS, UniProt, OMIM gene, MGI, RGD and STRING, and 2) the entities associated with the gene in a table format. Gene page 2.5.3 Ontology The Ontology page aims to provide further information on 1) the inheritance pattern of a disease as well as links to other platforms such as OMIM, DOID, MONDO and Orphanet, and 2) the entities associated with it in a table format. Ontology page 2.6 Analyses views Analyses views are aimed at allowing the use to have a more global picture on comparisons of SysNDD with other curations, phenotype correlations, SysNDD entries over time, NDD publications and functional gene clusters. 2.6.1 Compare curations Compare curations view is composed of three tabs: Overlap Similarity Table The Overlap tab includes an upset plot to show the overlap between SysNDD and other selected NDD curation efforts. Compare curations view: Overlap tab The Similarity tab includes a matrix plot of the cosine similarity between different curation efforts for neurodevelopmental disorders. Compare curations view: Similarity tab The Table tab displays a table format to compare the presence of a gene in different curation efforts for neurodevelopmental disorders. This tab has an additional feature that allows the comparison table to be downloaded as an Excel file. The filter removal button is located at the top right corner. Compare curations view: Table tab 2.6.2 Correlate phenotypes Correlate phenotypes view is composed of three tabs: Phenotype correlogram Phenotype counts Phenotype clustering The Phenotype correlogram tab displays a matrix of correlations of different phenotypes. Correlate phenotypes view: Phenotype correlogram tab The Phenotype counts tab shows a bar plot of phenotype counts. Correlate phenotypes view: Phenotype counts tab The Phenotype clustering tab shows clusters of entities based on phenotype annotations. Correlate phenotypes view: Phenotype clustering tab 2.6.3 Entries over time Entries over time view shows the changes in the NDD entity numbers since 2011. Entries over time view 2.6.4 NDD Publications -content coming soon- 2.6.5 Functional clusters Functional clusters view shows the functionally enriched gene clusters. Functional clusters view 2.7 About page The About page contains general information about the project, its creators, funding, updates, and how to find help. 2.8 Help &amp; Feedback A smiley face button (in blue, bottom right) is present on every page of SysNDD, and directs the users to the following help and feedback functions: Button 1 allows the user to cite the page (quotation mark icon) Button 2 directs the user to a form for positive feedback (thumbs up icon) Button 3 directs the user to a form for improvement suggestions (thumbs down icon) Button 4 directs the user to the SysNDD documentation (book icon) Button 5 directs the user to the SysNDD GitHub discussions page for questions and help (question mark icon) Help &amp; Feedback 2.9 Login page The Login page shows a simple form with inputs for the (1) user name and their (2) password, (3) buttons to reset the form and (4) links to registration and password reset. Login modal 2.9.1 Register user page This page can be used to apply for a SysNDD account by entering following information: desired username institutional E-mail ORCID identifier First name Family name description of your interest in SysNDD and why you want to participate in the curation effort and (7) accepting the terms of use. The (8) buttons allow resetting or submitting the form. Register modal Upon submission the curator status users will receive a mail to review your application. After your application has been confirmed you will receive a mail with your login information and instructions. 2.9.2 Reset password page The form on this page allows users who forgot their password to reset this by enetering the E-mail tehy registered with. Reset modal Upon submission the E-mail account will receive a message with a one-time link allowing the user to enter a new password. 2.10 Mobile website The Vue.js framework enables native cross platform development. Together with the Bootstrap CSS library this enables the SysNDD web app to seamlessly integrate on smaller mobile screens. Mobile site The layout breaks to mobile view at 768 pixels width and minimizes the navigation and footer menus: Mobile navbar Mobile footer All tables in mobile views break to a stacked view (column names becoem first column in a cell and values second column) to best use display space: Stacked table The table controls and search inputs are further dispalyed at the top in this view. The analyses pages on mobile pages are best viewed in landscape mode: Landscape mode 2.11 Progressive Web App (PWA) The SysNDD web app can also be installed on mobile devices using the Progressive Web App (PWA) technology. This is supported in all Chromium-based modern browsers (Chrome, Edge, Opera, etc.) on all common operating systems (Windows, Linux, maxOS and Android). Additionally new Safari versions on iOS show some support for PWA. PWAs are faster because they cache files. They offer more screen space for the app. Future integrations of this feature in SysNDD will enable offline use. To install the PWA on Android devices follow these steps: 1) Visit the SysNDD website at https://sysndd.dbmr.unibe.ch/. You will see a message offering to add the PWA to your home screen: PWA add 2) After clicking the previous message, confirm the installation by clicking “Install” in the following prompt: PWA install 3) A message will confirm the installation: PWA added 4) Following app symbol will be available on one of your screens: App symbol 5) Clicking this will open SysNDD in PWA mode (no browser adress bar, instead custom colored top bar): PWA screenshot 2.12 Performance Modern Javascript frameworks like Vue.js, which we use for the SysNDD website, offer rich user experience. The generated single-page applications can be slower then server side rendered pages. With SysNDD we are engaged to provide a fast user experience by reducing component and request sizes and applying techniques like lazy loading and code splitting in the frontend with parallelisation in the api. A quick overview on the current website performance can be obtained on PageSpeed Insights (or “Lighthouse” in the chrome development console): https://pagespeed.web.dev/report?url=https%3A%2F%2Fsysndd.dbmr.unibe.ch%2F 2.13 Security SysNDD is engaged to offer highest security standards for all web tools. We use HTTPS with Transport Layer Security (TLS) and follow the mozilla recommendations for web server settings. A quick overview for our security settings for the SysNDD website can be obtained on Mozilla Oservatory: https://observatory.mozilla.org/analyze/sysndd.dbmr.unibe.ch "],["404.html", "Page not found", " Page not found The page you requested cannot be found (perhaps it was moved or renamed).
