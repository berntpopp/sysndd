History of SysID and SysNDD SysNDD is based on its predecessor SysID (https://www.sysid.dbmr.unibe.ch/) which had been published in 2016 ((Kochinke et al. 2016)). Christiane Zweier has been involved in establishing and updating SysID from its start in 2009. She has since performed and coordinated curation and regular updates. The PHP based SysID web tool (Yii 2 framework) was however not further developed and maintained besides necessary bugfixes. After the maintenance agreement for the original server at the CMBI at Radboud University in Nijmegen ran out the installation was moved to a virtual server at the Department for BioMedical Research (DBMR) at the University Bern. The former link from the initial publication is re-directed so it still works. The legacy code base was updated to allow installation and security fixes and uploaded to a GitHub repository. In 2019 the chance arose to integrate the SysID curation effort into the Orphanet resource. In the process of aligning the curation and naming conventions for genes, diseases and phenotypes we decided to redesign the database and web tool. The SysNDD concept SysNDD now conatins a manually curated catalogue of published gene-disease-associations implicated in neurodevelopmental disorders (NDD). To allow interoperability and mapping between gene-, phenotype- or disease-oriented databases, we center our approach around curated gene-inheritance-disease units, so called entities. These entities are classified into different confidence status (categories: Definitive, Moderate, Limited, Refuted) according to the degree of underlying scientific evidence. Furthermore, manually curated information on associated diseases and phenotypes is provided. The entries in SysNDD are currently updated every 3-4 months and can be utilized for a broad spectrum of tasks from both research and diagnostics. One of our long-term goals is to incorporate the SysNDD data into other gene/ disease-relationship databases like the Orphanet ontology. Bernt Popp (scientist at the Institute of Human Genetics at the University Hospital Leipzig, Germany) developed and programmed the SysNDD tools and will be integrating further functionality including variants associated with entities in future updates.

However, there are many unique causes of rare diseases, thus many individuals are be affected by such a disease. Due to the rarity of each single entity, effective management, surveillance and treatment is complicated. So is finding the correct diagnosis, which is often described as the diagnostic odyssey. Rare diseases often have a genetic cause, making high-throughput sequencing (next-generations sequencing; NGS) a central part of finding the molecular diagnosis. 1.1 Neurodevelopmental disorders Neurodevelopmental disorders (NDD) affect about 2% of children. They represent a clinically and genetically extremely heterogeneous disease group comprising developmental delay (DD), intellectual disability (ID) and autism spectrum disorder (ASD). 1.2 Genetic heterogeneity This is heterogeneity is evident when looking at the published gene associations over time. Thus the question arises: How can we keep track of this fast development and have the information at hand when we need it in the clinic or when analyzing sequencing data? While the answer to this question is easy: We need curated databases to catalogue and summarize the wealth of published information. The task at hand is not only complicated and laborious but also requires expertise and consistence. 1.3 Expert curation In our mind the curation of gene-disease relationships in a rare disease requires clinical and scientific proficiency in the respective field. This implies that clinician scientists involved in counseling, diagnostics and research of NDD are predestined for this task. To reduce workload and dependence on single experts, a distributed effort in larger consortia and collaboration between different work groups is needed. In the course of updating SysID we had the great chance contribute the data to Orphanet to create a European ID/NDD specific reference list. With support from the ITHACA Workgroup: intellectual disability in 2019 we started working with the Orphanet team which is part of the Gene Curation Coalition (GenCC). This collaboration was a perfect opportunity to recrute expert curators and enable broad sharing and application of the curated database contents. 1.4 Technical concepts In addition to a pool of experts, the right tools are needed for a successful effort. We defined gene-inheritance-disease units as entities which represent the central curation effort. The components of these entities are normalized using widely used and standardized ontology terms (e.g. HGNC identifier for genes, OMIM or MONDO for disease and inheritance from HPO). This allows interoperability and linking to other data sources. Based on this concept we developed a new database scheme, which allows entities to be systematically and reproducibly be cataloged. The database is abstracted into a JSON API, which allows structured programmatic access to the underlying data. Finally, the API feeds the web tool which can be used to easily search, filter, download and visualize the database contents in modern webbrowsers. 1.5 Outlook The SysNDD database will improve the understanding and curation of rare NDD entities. SysNDD will enable systems biology and network analyses. Our long-term goal is incorporation of the high-quality, manually curated SysNDD data into European and international gene disease relationship databases, thus improving diagnostics and care for individuals with rare NDDs.

Publication required (no grey literature like conference abstracts or personal communication; manuscripts on preprint servers can be considered individually but only entered through their DOI in the comment field until published with PMID, when they should be updated) AND 2. Clear-cut frequency &gt; no further criteria needed - &gt;= 10 cases with de novo variants - &gt;= 5 autosomal-recessive families - &gt;= 3 families with X-chromosomal variants OR 3. Cumulative evidence 1 strong frequency criterium PLUS 1 strong genetic or 1 strong clinical criterium OR 2 further strong (genetic and/or clinical) criteria in case of only 2 recessive OR &gt;= two moderate criteria 5.2.1 Strong criteria Strong frequency criteria: &gt;= 3 patients with de novo variant &gt;= 2 families with bi-allelic truncating variants &gt;= (2-)3 families with bi-allelic missense variants &gt;= 2 families with X-chromosomal variants Strong genetic criteria: recurrence of a variant clustering of variants de novo truncating variants in a gene intolerant to loss-of-function variants (gnomAD constraint score) Strong clinical criteria: Homogeneous phenotype Presence of specific/distinct clinical aspects (e.g. recognizable facial gestalt; rare specific malformations; pattern of multiple malformation; characteristic MRI anomalies; specific metabolic/enzymatic anomalies) 5.2.2 Moderate criteria Multigenerational segregation of variants Functional tests Gene involved in a pathway/complex where variants in other subunits are associated with a similar phenotype De novo missense variants in a gene intolerant to missense variants (gnomAD constraint scores) 5.2.3 Possible negative criteria These should be included into consideration in borderline cases. Age of first publication(s) without further confirmatory reports in the meantime Publication quality and journal or genetics expertise doubtful New evidence against gene and/or variants: e.g. constraint scores, frequencies in gnomAD 5.3 NDD Moderate and Limited entities These categories include the previous category of  candidate genes and are now split into criteria for category 2 (Moderate) and 3 (Limited): 1. Must be published (no private, in-house candidate lists) AND 2. ID indicated, but criteria not sufficient for category 1, examples: a. Limited genetic evidence &lt; 3 cases with de novo, different variants and non-specific NDD phenotype 1 recessive family with truncating variant or &lt;= 2 recessive families with missense variants (category 2 or 3 depending on number of affected and tested individuals per family, functional evidence and homogeneity of phenotype etc.) candidate gene from translocation or larger deletion reports of enzymatically confirmed patients with specific metabolic disorders but without genetic mutation confirmed b. Limited clinical evidence not much evidence for ID, e.g. reported as ADHD or ASD or neurological disorder without clearly reported low IQ and ID known disorder, but only single patients reported with ID motor developmental delay without evidence for cognitive impairment clear neurodegenerative course without ID or cognitive delay present in the first years lethal before ID might be evident, although e.g. brain malformations or metabolic abnormalities might point to ID ID reported in other, similar disorders caused by mutations in the same pathway/complex but not (yet) in association with this particular gene (e.g. Fanconi anemia) c. Limited combined genetic and clinical evidence Gene enriched for de novo or rare deleterious variants in large NDD cohorts or meta-studies, no further details 5.3.1 Exclusion criteria Published as candidate gene only based on function or experimental results but without variants reported in humans AND/OR Only 1 de novo case from longer ago without further evidence and gene tolerant towards missense and/or loss-of-function variants according to gnomAD constraint scores AND/OR Only 1 sporadic case with bi-allelic variants and without any further supporting evidence such as segregation in other family members, functional tests, similar phenotypes in other patients with variants in genes from the same pathway, etc. 5.3.2 When to choose category 2 (Moderate)? Too good for category 3 (Limited) but not good enough for category 1 (Definitive) Examples: Recurrent de novo variant in 2 individuals with a similar phenotype Bi-allelic or X-chromosomal truncating variant segregating in &gt;= two generations of a large family Convincing functional evidence 1-2 patients with convincing variants in a gene which is in the same complex/pathway with other known disease genes and phenotype fits (e.g. CDG syndrome) "],["re-review-instructions.html", "Chapter | 6 Re-review instructions 6.1 Re-review tool usage 6.2 Re-review curation", " Chapter | 6 Re-review instructions The goal of the SysNDD Re-Review effort is to update and standardize the SysID entities collected during the past years to enable better integration into and interoperability international with gene curations. 6.1 Re-review tool usage We created Reviewer status accounts for participating scientists. 6.1.1 Login You can log into your account by pointing your browser to https://sysndd.dbmr.unibe.ch/ and then clicking the Login link on the right side of the menu: On the Login page enter your credentials and press the Login button: After successful login, you will be redirected to the start page and the navigation bar will show new links depending on your account privileges: Your login token (JWT; JSON Web Token) is valid for 1 hour, after which you will be logged out.

Please also check and revise severity of ID using HPO terms. If ID is very variable, select all appropriate ID terms (e.g. severe, moderate, mild, borderline) Check references (OMIM, PMID, GeneReviews). References do not have to be complete but should be sufficient to give a good impression on the mutational and clinical spectrum. Add references where it would add to the picture. Check and revise clinical synopsis: it does not have to contain everything that is known but should give a short and comprehensive picture on: which data the gene and disease category was chosen and the molecular and clinical picture. Please include information on: approximate number of patients described in literature, nature of reported variants, b) severity of intellectual disability, further phenotypic aspects (if possible with frequencies), any valuable further information (e.g. genotype-phenotype correlations) Examples: de novo truncating or missense variants in &gt; 20 individuals: variable ID (mild to severe), 50% short stature and microcephaly, 30% seizures, non-specific facial dysmorphism, variable cardiac and renal anomalies in some bi-allelic truncating variants in 7 individuals from 3 families: severe ID, microcephaly, seizures in 3/7, MRI anomalies 6.2.2 Moderate and Limited association status Check if inclusion criteria for candidate genes are still fulfilled or if it should be deleted from the list (Refuted) Check if candidate status is still correct and sort it into Category 2 (Moderate) and 3 (Limited) (or reclassify to 1 (Definitive), if applicable) Check, if associated phenotype still fits Check, if references are correct, if there is any new published information and modify clinical synopsis where appropriate Clinical synopsis can be very short for candidate genes no associated phenotypes (HPO terms) and frequencies are needed for candidate genes, but could be helpful Examples: de novo missense variants in 2 individuals: autism, ID in 1/2 bi-allelic missense variant in 2 affected individuals from 1 family: moderate ID, MRI anomalies 6.2.3 Refuted association status Check if there is current evidence against this gene association (e.g. few truncating variants described in old publications before gnomAD constrain scores and the gene now has a pLI of 0; genes reported in a family with later report of another cause etc.) "],["404.html", "Page not found", " Page not found The page you requested cannot be found (perhaps it was moved or renamed).
