[["index.html", "The SysNDD Documentation Preface History of SysID and SysNDD The SysNDD concept Support and Funding", " The SysNDD Documentation Bernt Popp, Melek Firat Altay, Christiane Zweier 2023-01-16 Preface This documentation is intended to describe the SysNDD project and provide instructions for regular user show to use the tool and for curator status users how to perform reviews and how to enter data. History of SysID and SysNDD SysNDD is based on its predecessor SysID, conceived by Annette Schenck and Christiane Zweier in 2009 and published in 2016 (Kochinke et al., 2016). Christiane Zweier has been involved in establishing and updating SysID from its start. She has since performed and coordinated curation and regular updates. The PHP based SysID web tool (Yii 2 framework) was however not further developed and maintained besides necessary bugfixes. After the maintenance agreement for the original server at the CMBI at Radboud University in Nijmegen ran out, the installation was moved to a virtual server at the Department for BioMedical Research (DBMR) at the University Bern. The former link from the initial publication is re-directed so it still works. The legacy code base was updated to allow installation and security fixes and to be uploaded to a GitHub repository (SysID). After the first SysNDD native updates to the curated entities, we display a warning popup on the SysID page to show that the content is not curated any more. In 2019 the chance arose to integrate the SysID curation effort with the Orphanet resource, supported by ERN ITHACA. In the process of aligning the curation and naming conventions for genes, diseases and phenotypes we decided to redesign the database and web tool. The SysNDD concept SysNDD contains our latest update of the manually curated catalogue of published gene-disease-associations implicated in neurodevelopmental disorders (NDD). To allow interoperability and mapping between gene-, phenotype- or disease-oriented databases, we center our approach around curated gene-inheritance-disease units, so called entities. These entities are classified into different confidence status (categories: Definitive, Moderate, Limited, Refuted) according to the degree of underlying scientific evidence. Furthermore, manually curated information on associated phenotypes is provided. The entries in SysNDD are currently updated every 3-4 months and can be utilized for a broad spectrum of tasks from both research and diagnostics. One of our goals is to incorporate the SysID/ SysNDD data into other gene/ disease-relationship databases like the Orphanet ontology (first results: id-genes.orphanet.app). Bernt Popp (scientist at the Institute of Human Genetics at the University Hospital Leipzig, Germany) developed and programmed the SysNDD tool and will be integrating further functionality including variants associated with entities in future updates. Support and Funding The current SysNDD database development is supported by: DFG (Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft) grant PO2366/2-1 to Bernt Popp. DFG (Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft) grant ZW184/6-1 to Christiane Zweier.

However, there are many unique causes of rare diseases, thus many individuals are affected by such a disease. Due to the rarity of each single entity, effective management, surveillance and treatment is challenging. So is finding the correct diagnosis, which is often described as the diagnostic odyssey. Rare diseases often have a genetic cause, making high-throughput sequencing (next-generation sequencing; NGS) a central part of finding the molecular diagnosis. 1.1 Neurodevelopmental disorders Neurodevelopmental disorders (NDDs) affect about 2% of children. They represent a clinically and genetically extremely heterogeneous disease group comprising amongst other developmental delay (DD), intellectual disability (ID) and autism spectrum disorder (ASD) and developmental and epileptic encephalopathies (DEE). 1.2 Genetic heterogeneity The huge genetic heterogeneity is evident when looking at the published gene-disease associations over time. Thus the question arises: How can we keep track of this fast development and have the information at hand when we need it in the clinic or when analysing sequencing data? While the answer to this question is easy: We need curated databases to catalogue and summarise the wealth of published information. The task at hand is not only laborious but also requires expertise and consistence. 1.3 Expert curation In our opinion, the curation of gene-disease relationships in rare disease such as NDDs requires clinical and scientific proficiency in the respective field. This implies that clinician scientists involved in counseling, diagnostics and research of NDDs are predestined for this task. To reduce workload and dependence on single experts, a distributed effort in larger consortia and collaboration between different work groups is needed. In the course of updating SysID we had the great chance to contribute our data to Orphanet to create a European ID/NDD specific reference list. With support from the ITHACA Workgroup: intellectual disability (id-genes.orphanet.app) in 2019 we started working with the Orphanet team which is part of the Gene Curation Coalition (GenCC). Additionally, we are able to recruit expert curators from ERN ITHACA to contribute to re-curation of old data and updating new data in SysNDD. 1.4 Technical concepts In addition to a pool of experts, the right tools are needed. We defined gene-inheritance-disease units as entities which represent the central curation effort. The components of these entities are normalized using widely used and standardized ontology terms (e.g. HGNC identifier for genes, OMIM or MONDO for disease and inheritance from HPO). This allows inter-operability and linking to other data sources. Based on this concept we developed a new database scheme, which allows entities to be systematically and reproducibly cataloged. The database is abstracted into a JSON API, which allows structured programmatic access to the underlying data. Finally, the API feeds the web tool which can be used to easily search, filter, download and visualize the database contents in modern web browsers. 1.5 Outlook The SysNDD database will improve the understanding and curation of rare NDD entities. SysNDD will enable systems biology and network analyses. Our long-term goal is incorporation of the high-quality, manually curated SysNDD data into European and international gene disease relationship databases, thus, improving diagnostics and care for individuals with rare NDDs.

Together with the Bootstrap CSS library, this enables the SysNDD web app to integrate seamlessly on smaller mobile screens. Mobile site The layout breaks to mobile view at 768 pixels width and minimizes the navigation and footer menus: Mobile navbar Mobile footer All tables in mobile views break to a stacked view (column names become the first column in a cell and values the second column) to best use display space: Stacked table The table controls and search inputs are further displayed at the top in this view. The Analyses pages on mobile are best viewed in landscape mode: Landscape mode 2.11 Progressive Web App (PWA) The SysNDD web app can also be installed on mobile devices using the Progressive Web App (PWA) technology. This is supported in all Chromium-based modern browsers (Chrome, Edge, Opera, etc.) on all common operating systems (Windows, Linux, maxOS and Android). Additionally new Safari versions on iOS show some support for PWA. PWAs are faster because they cache files. They offer more screen space for the app. Future integrations of this feature in SysNDD will enable offline use. To install the PWA on Android devices follow these steps: 1) Visit the SysNDD website at https://sysndd.dbmr.unibe.ch/. You will see a message offering to add the PWA to your home screen: PWA add 2) After clicking the previous message, confirm the installation by clicking Install in the following prompt: PWA install 3) A message will confirm the installation: PWA added 4) Following app symbol will be available on one of your screens: App symbol 5) Clicking this will open SysNDD in PWA mode (no browser address bar, instead custom coloured top bar): PWA screenshot 2.12 Performance Modern Javascript frameworks like Vue.js, which we use for the SysNDD website, offer rich user experience. The generated single-page applications can be slower than server side rendered pages. With SysNDD we are engaged to provide a fast user experience by reducing component and request sizes and applying techniques like lazy loading and code splitting in the frontend with parallelisation in the api. A quick overview on the current website performance can be obtained on PageSpeed Insights (or Lighthouse in the chrome development console): https://pagespeed.web.dev/report?url=https%3A%2F%2Fsysndd.dbmr.unibe.ch%2F 2.13 Security SysNDD is engaged to offer highest security standards for all web tools. We use HTTPS with Transport Layer Security (TLS) and follow the Mozilla recommendations for web server settings. A quick overview for our security settings for the SysNDD website can be obtained on Mozilla Observatory: https://observatory.mozilla.org/analyze/sysndd.dbmr.unibe.ch "],["api.html", "Chapter | 3 API", " Chapter | 3 API The SysNDD api (application programming interface) is available from https://sysndd.dbmr.unibe.ch/API. The api is written in R using the plumber package. We intend to follow the Swagger/ OpenAPI and JSON:API specifications. The api scripts run in a Docker container using the official rocker/tidyverse image (version 4.2.0). As R is single threaded, we deploy multiple instances of the api container. These are bundled together using HAProxy load balancer. The api is rate limited through our NGINX web server configuration with a rate limit of 10 requests per second (10r/s; equals 1 request every 100 milliseconds) per requesting ip. The configuration allows bursts of up to 30r/s but introduces a delay after 10 requests to enforce the rate limit. 3.0.1 Endpoints The SysNDD api currently contains all endpoints for externala nd internal usage in one api script. This may change with future releases. The api is structured into different components based on the SysND concept: entity: Entity related endpoints review: Reviews related endpoints status: Status related endpoints re_review: Re-review related endpoints publication: Publication related endpoints gene: Gene related endpoints ontology: Ontology related endpoints inheritance: Inheritance related endpoints phenotype: Phenoptype related endpoints panels: Gene panel related endpoints comparisons: NDD gene list comparisons related endpoints search: Database search related endpoints list: Database list related endpoints statistics: Database statistics user: User account related endpoints authentication: Authentication related endpoints The endpoints are documented and can be tested using the Swagger/ OpenAPI user interface at https://sysndd.dbmr.unibe.ch/API. Here one can generate cURL requests to use in external software. 3.0.2 Usage policy The SysNDD api powers the web tool for everyday users. We also provide the SysNDD api free to allow users to use the SysNDD data and build on it by creating software or services that connect to our platform. Usage requirements: optimize your requests to stay in the above described limits be sensible about re-using data (e.g., store your requests until data is updated on our server) use pagination where possible instead of requesting large data chunks (e.g., restrict usage of all option in large, potentially blocking list endpoints like entity and gene) if you require more api ressources please get in contact Updates and disclaimer: We provide the SysNDD api as is. Due to the current development status (version 0.X.Y) we may update or modify the api any time. These changes may affect your use of the api or the way your integration interacts with the api. 3.0.3 Authentication and authorization The SysNDD api uses JSON Web Tokens (JWT) to implement stateless authentication and authorization. The api user can manually (test purposes) request a token by entering their login credentials in the input form provided at the api/auth/authenticate endpoint: Authenticate endpoint This endpoint will generate and respond with and JWT token: JWT token This Bearer token can then be copied and entered in the OpenAPI/ Swagger authorize modal, which opens after clicking the Authorize modal button at the upper right corner: Authorize button Authorize modal prompt After entering the token in the respective field (1) and clicking the Authorize submission button the modal will change and show the login status. This field can be closed now: Authorize modal logged in The user is now fully authenticated and can access the endpoints requiring user rights: API logged in The token is valid for 60 minutes. It can be refreshed using the endpoint api/auth/refresh.

If ID is very variable, select all appropriate ID terms (e.g. severe, moderate, mild, borderline) Check references (OMIM, PMID, GeneReviews). References do not have to be complete but should be sufficient to give a good impression on the mutational and clinical spectrum. Add references where it would add to the picture. Check and revise clinical synopsis: it does not have to contain everything that is known but should give a short and comprehensive picture on: which data the gene and disease category were chosen on and the molecular and clinical picture. Please include information on: approximate number of patients described in literature, nature of reported variants, severity of intellectual disability, further phenotypic aspects (if possible with frequencies), any valuable further information (e.g. genotype-phenotype correlations) Examples: de novo truncating or missense variants in &gt; 20 individuals: variable ID (mild to severe), 50% short stature and microcephaly, 30% seizures, non-specific facial dysmorphism, variable cardiac and renal anomalies in some bi-allelic truncating variants in 7 individuals from 3 families: severe ID, microcephaly, seizures in 3/7, MRI anomalies 6.2.2 Moderate and Limited association status Check if inclusion criteria for candidate genes are still fulfilled or if it should be deleted from the list (Refuted) Check if candidate status is still correct and sort it into Category 2 (Moderate) and 3 (Limited) (or reclassify to 1 (Definitive), if applicable) Check, if associated phenotype still fits Check, if references are correct, if there is any new published information and modify clinical synopsis where appropriate Clinical synopsis can be very short for candidate genes no associated phenotypes (HPO terms) and frequencies are needed for candidate genes, but could be helpful Examples: de novo missense variants in 2 individuals: autism, ID in 50% bi-allelic missense variant in 2 affected individuals from 1 family: moderate ID, MRI anomalies 6.2.3 Refuted association status Check if there is current evidence against this gene association (e.g. few truncating variants described in old publications before gnomAD constrain scores and the gene now has a pLI of 0; genes reported in a family with later report of another cause etc.) "],["references.html", "References", " References Kochinke, K., Zweier, C., Nijhof, B., Fenckova, M., Cizek, P., Honti, F., Keerthikumar, S., Oortveld, M.
