    "content": "The SysNDD database is based on some content of its predecessor database, SysID (http://sysid.cmbi.umcn.nl/, more recently https://www.sysid.dbmr.unibe.ch/). The concept for a curated gene collection and database with the goal to facilitate research and diagnostics into NDDs has been conceived by Annette Schenck and Christiane Zweier.\n\nIn 2009, they established SysID with a manually curated catalog of published genes implicated in neurodevelopmental disorders (NDDs), classified into primary and candidate genes according to the degree of underlying evidence. Furthermore, expert curated information on associated diseases and phenotypes was provided.\n\nChristiane Zweier has been updating SysID from its start in 2009. Together with her, Bernt Popp has now developed and programmed the new SysNDD database.\n\nTo allow interoperability and mapping between gene-, phenotype- or disease-oriented databases, SysNDD is centered around curated gene-inheritance-disease units, so called entities, which are classified based on three evidence categories. This can account for the increased complexity of NDDs and allows to address a broader spectrum of diagnostic and research questions.\n\nFuture functionality will be expanded to annotation of variant and network analyses. Another goal is to incorporate the SysID/SysNDD data into other gene/disease-relationship databases like the Orphanet Rare Disease ontology database.\n\n## Affiliations\n\n- **Christiane Zweier:** previously: Institute of Human Genetics, University Hospital, FAU Erlangen, Germany; now: Human Genetics at the University/University Hospital Bern, Switzerland\n- **Bernt Popp:** senior physician at the Berlin Institute of Health (BIH) at Charite Berlin, Germany and scientist at the Institute of Human Genetics at the University Hospital Leipzig, Germany\n- **Annette Schenck:** Radboud university medical center, Nijmegen, the Netherlands",
