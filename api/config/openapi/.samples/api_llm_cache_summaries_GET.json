These genes drive essential microtubule-based processes and intraflagellar transport, which are critical for both cellular architecture and mitotic cell cycle progression. Deficits in this cluster are strongly linked to ciliopathies and neurodevelopmental abnormalities, often presenting with structural brain malformations.\", \"pathways\": [\"Phagosome\", \"Gap junction\", \"Huntington disease\", \"Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis\", \"Pathogenic Escherichia coli infection\", \"Parkinson disease\", \"Prion disease\", \"Vasopressin-regulated water reabsorption\"], \"confidence\": \"high\", \"key_themes\": [\"Cilium organization and assembly\", \"Microtubule cytoskeleton organization\", \"Centrosome and centriole maintenance\", \"Mitotic cell cycle and spindle organization\", \"Ciliary basal body-plasma membrane docking\"], \"llm_judge_verdict\": \"accept\", \"clinical_relevance\": \"Clinically, this cluster is defined by its association with Joubert syndrome, Bardet-Biedl syndrome, and Meckel syndrome. Key diagnostic markers from HPO data include the molar tooth sign on MRI, abnormality of neuronal migration, cerebellar hypoplasia, and aplasia/hypoplasia of the corpus callosum.\", \"derived_confidence\": {\"score\": \"low\", \"avg_fdr\": 0.0041, \"term_count\": 1377}, \"llm_judge_reasoning\": \"The summary is perfectly grounded in the provided data. All themes are supported by terms with extremely high significance (FDR < 1e-80), and the listed pathways appear verbatim in the KEGG enrichment results. The summary accurately synthesizes the microtubule and ciliary functions with the clinical relevance of ciliopathies and neurodevelopmental disorders.\"}",
