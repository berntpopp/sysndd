# Milestone v7.0: Curation Workflow Modernization

**Status:** SHIPPED 2026-01-27
**Phases:** 34-39 (including 35.1)
**Total Plans:** 21

## Overview

This roadmap transforms curation views from basic forms into modern, accessible interfaces. Starting with critical bug fixes that unblock basic functionality, we progress through restoring multi-select capabilities, modernizing tables with the TablesEntities pattern established in v6, extracting reusable form components, overhauling the re-review system with dynamic batch management, and completing an accessibility pass. Each phase delivers observable improvements curators can use immediately.

## Phases

### Phase 34: Critical Bug Fixes

**Goal**: Restore basic curation functionality by fixing blocking bugs
**Depends on**: Nothing (first phase of v7.0)
**Requirements**: BUG-01, BUG-02, BUG-03, BUG-04
**Plans**: 2 plans

Plans:
- [x] 34-01-PLAN.md - Fix ApproveUser crash, component name, modal staleness (BUG-01, BUG-03, BUG-04)
- [x] 34-02-PLAN.md - Fix ModifyEntity dropdown, component names (BUG-02, BUG-03)

**Success Criteria:**
1. ApproveUser page loads without JavaScript errors and displays user list
2. ModifyEntity status dropdown shows all status options when opened
3. Component names in Vue DevTools match file names (no "ApproveStatus" for ManageReReview)
4. Opening modal for different entity shows fresh data (not stale data from previous entity)

### Phase 35: Multi-Select Restoration

**Goal**: Restore multi-select capability for phenotypes and variations using custom TreeMultiSelect component built with Bootstrap-Vue-Next primitives (BFormTags, BDropdown, BCollapse, BFormCheckbox)
**Depends on**: Phase 34
**Requirements**: MSEL-01, MSEL-02, MSEL-03, MSEL-04
**Plans**: 3 plans

Plans:
- [x] 35-01-PLAN.md - Create TreeMultiSelect component foundation (composables, TreeNode, TreeMultiSelect wrapper)
- [x] 35-02-PLAN.md - Integrate TreeMultiSelect into curation views (Review, ModifyEntity, ApproveReview)
- [x] 35-03-PLAN.md - Remove vue3-treeselect dependency and verify functionality

**Success Criteria:**
1. User can select multiple phenotypes from hierarchical list in Review form
2. User can select multiple variations from hierarchical list in Review form
3. ModifyEntity and ApproveReview use same multi-select pattern
4. vue3-treeselect is removed from package.json

### Phase 35.1: ModifyEntity UX Overhaul (INSERTED)

**Goal**: Complete ModifyEntity.vue UX modernization with enhanced entity preview, contextual modal headers, and modernized form controls
**Depends on**: Phase 35
**Requirements**: MEU-01, MEU-02, MEU-03, MEU-04
**Plans**: 2 plans

Plans:
- [x] 35.1-01-PLAN.md - Enhanced entity preview with badge components (GeneBadge, DiseaseBadge, EntityBadge, colorAndSymbols)
- [x] 35.1-02-PLAN.md - Rich modal headers, BFormCheckbox switches, and action button loading states

**Success Criteria:**
1. Entity preview card shows gene symbol (HGNC link), disease name (ontology link), inheritance icon, category stoplight, NDD status
2. All 4 modal headers show rich entity context (Gene | Disease | Inheritance | Category) with colorAndSymbols icons
3. All form controls use BFormCheckbox with switch prop (no custom-control-switch CSS)
4. Action buttons disabled until entity_loaded is true, with BSpinner during submission

### Phase 36: Curation Table Modernization

**Goal**: Apply TablesEntities pattern to curation tables for consistent UX with column filters, standardized pagination, and accessibility improvements
**Depends on**: Phase 35
**Requirements**: TBL-01, TBL-02, TBL-03, TBL-04, TBL-05, TBL-06

**Success Criteria:**
1. ApproveReview table has column filters (category, user, date range)
2. ApproveStatus table has column filters (category, user, date range)
3. All curation views use standardized pagination (10, 25, 50, 100 options)
4. ManageReReview table has search functionality
5. All curation action buttons have aria-label attributes and tooltips

### Phase 37: Form Modernization

**Goal**: Extract reusable form patterns and improve form UX

2. ModifyEntity has search/autocomplete instead of numeric ID input
3. Modification forms can save draft and resume later
4. useReviewForm composable exists and is used in Review.vue

2. Admin can assign specific genes to specific users for re-review
3. Admin can recalculate/reassign batch contents based on updated criteria
4. ManageReReview no longer filters by hardcoded 2020-01-01 date

## Milestone Summary

**Decimal Phases:**
- Phase 35.1: ModifyEntity UX Overhaul (inserted after Phase 35 for urgent UX modernization)

**Key Decisions:**
- Bootstrap-Vue-Next only (no PrimeVue) for multi-select — ecosystem consistency
- Options API for recursive TreeNode component — script setup doesn't support self-reference
- Ancestor context preservation in tree search — improves hierarchy discoverability
- null vs [] for loading state — null = not yet loaded, [] = loaded but empty
- Composable-based form extraction following useEntityForm pattern
- Draft persistence via useFormDraft with auto-save and restoration prompts
- Parameterized query approach for batch management (re-review-service.R)
- Entity overlap prevention in batch creation via exclusion subquery
- Bootstrap visually-hidden class for screen-reader-only CSS
- Dual feedback pattern (makeToast + announce) for all CRUD operations

**Issues Resolved:**
- ApproveUser page crash (TypeError: reduce is not a function)
- ModifyEntity status dropdown showing empty options
- Component name mismatches (ManageReReview had name "ApproveStatus")
- Modal data staleness (form not reset when opening for different entity)
- vue3-treeselect dependency removed (custom TreeMultiSelect component)
- Hardcoded 2020-01-01 batch filter removed
- IconLegend prop name mismatch fixed (`:items` → `:legend-items`)
- Review.vue missing aria-hidden on decorative icons fixed

**Issues Deferred:**
- ModifyEntity review modal not refactored to useReviewForm (future cleanup)
- No StatusFormFields component extracted (future cleanup)
- No unit tests for form composables (future milestone)
- Server-side pagination for curation tables (v8+)
- TreeMultiSelect performance with >1000 nodes not validated

**Technical Debt Incurred:**
- Phase 35 missing VERIFICATION.md (components verified through downstream usage)
- A11Y-05 (keyboard navigation) needs manual human verification
- 9 tech debt items across 4 phases (see v7.0-MILESTONE-AUDIT.md)
