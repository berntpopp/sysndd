# Dependency graph
requires:
  - phase: 57
    provides: PubTator async job infrastructure
provides:
  - Secure SQL operations in pubtator_db_update_async() via parameterized queries
  - No SQL injection vulnerability in async PubTator operations
  - Consistent db-helpers usage pattern for direct connections
affects: [59, 60]

# Tech tracking
tech-stack:
  added: []
  patterns:
    - "db_execute_query/db_execute_statement with conn parameter for direct connections"
    - "Manual transaction handling (dbBegin/dbCommit/dbRollback) with parameterized queries"

key-files:
  created: []
  modified:
    - api/functions/pubtator-functions.R

key-decisions:
  - "Preserve manual transaction handling - db_with_transaction uses pool, not direct connections"
  - "Use NA values directly in parameter lists - DBI handles NA to NULL conversion automatically"

patterns-established:
  - "Direct connection parameterized queries: db_execute_query(sql, params, conn = conn)"
  - "Direct connection parameterized statements: db_execute_statement(sql, params, conn = conn)"

# Phase 57.1 Plan 01: PubTator Async Repository Refactor Summary

**Eliminated SQL injection vulnerability in pubtator_db_update_async() by replacing all sprintf-based SQL construction with parameterized queries using db_execute_query() and db_execute_statement()**

## Performance

- **Duration:** 3 min
- **Started:** 2026-01-31T22:31:51Z
- **Completed:** 2026-01-31T22:34:48Z
- **Tasks:** 3/3
- **Files modified:** 1

## Accomplishments

- Converted all SELECT queries to use `db_execute_query()` with ? placeholders and `conn = conn` parameter
- Converted all INSERT/UPDATE/DELETE statements to use `db_execute_statement()` with ? placeholders
- Removed all manual SQL escaping (gsub for single quotes) - DBI handles NA/NULL automatically
- Gene symbol computation JOIN query now uses parameterized approach
- Preserved manual transaction handling (dbBegin/dbCommit/dbRollback) for mirai daemon context

## Task Commits

All tasks completed in a single atomic commit (tasks are interdependent - partial refactoring would leave code in inconsistent state):

1. **Task 1: Refactor query operations** - `691c3404` (refactor)
2. **Task 2: Refactor statement operations** - `691c3404` (refactor)
3. **Task 3: Gene symbol computation and verification** - `691c3404` (refactor)

## Files Created/Modified

- `api/functions/pubtator-functions.R` - pubtator_db_update_async() now uses parameterized queries for all SQL operations

## Decisions Made

| Decision | Rationale | Impact |
|----------|-----------|--------|
| Single commit for all tasks | Tasks are interdependent - partial refactoring would break the function | Atomic change ensures code is always in working state |
| Preserve manual transaction handling | db_with_transaction uses pool, mirai daemons need direct connections | dbBegin/dbCommit/dbRollback still used, only query execution changed |
| Use NA directly in params | DBI's dbBind() handles NA to NULL conversion automatically | Simpler code, no manual ifelse(is.na(...), "NULL", ...) needed |

## Deviations from Plan

None - plan executed exactly as written.

## Issues Encountered

- **R not installed in execution environment:** Unable to run `make lint-api` and `make test-api` directly
  - **Resolution:** Verified code structure and syntax manually; 120-char line limit verified; no sprintf SQL construction remains in async function
  - **Note:** Tests should be run before merging via CI pipeline or local Docker environment

## User Setup Required

None - no external service configuration required.

## Next Phase Readiness

- pubtator_db_update_async() is now secure against SQL injection
- Async job submission endpoint (/api/jobs/pubtator_update/submit) maintains same interface
- Ready for Phase 59 (LLM Batch & Caching) which may use similar patterns
