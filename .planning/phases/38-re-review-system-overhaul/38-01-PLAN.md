<objective>
Create re-review-service.R with batch management business logic

Purpose: Provide service layer for dynamic batch creation with criteria-based entity selection, assignment workflows, and lifecycle management. This replaces the hardcoded pre-computed batch system with flexible, on-demand batch creation.

Output: api/services/re-review-service.R with functions for batch_create(), batch_assign(), batch_reassign(), batch_preview(), batch_archive(), and build_batch_where_clause() helper.

<task type="auto">
  <name>Task 1: Create re-review-service.R with batch management functions</name>
  <files>api/services/re-review-service.R</files>
  <action>
Create `api/services/re-review-service.R` following the established service layer patterns from status-service.R and entity-service.R.

**File header:**
```r
# Re-Review Service Layer for SysNDD API
# Provides business logic for dynamic batch management
#
# Functions accept pool as parameter (dependency injection)
# Handles batch creation, assignment, reassignment, and lifecycle
```

**Function 1: build_batch_where_clause(criteria, pool)**
- Build dynamic WHERE clause from criteria object
- Support date_range (start, end), gene_list (array of hgnc_ids), status_filter (category_id), disease_id
- Use glue_sql() with .con parameter for safe interpolation
- Return SQL string (without WHERE keyword)
- If no criteria, return "1=1" (match all)

**Function 2: batch_preview(criteria, batch_size, pool)**
- Return matching entities WITHOUT creating batch
- Use build_batch_where_clause() for filtering
- Exclude entities already in active batches (see below for exclusion query)
- Order by review_date ASC (oldest first per CONTEXT decision)
- Limit to batch_size (default 20)
- Return list with status=200 and data=tibble of matching entities

**Function 3: batch_create(criteria, assigned_user_id, batch_name, pool)**
- Validate at least one criterion provided
- Use db_with_transaction() for atomicity (CRITICAL - see pitfall #2 in RESEARCH)
- Inside transaction:
  1. Generate batch_name if NULL: format "Batch YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM"
  2. Insert into re_review_entity_connect with new batch_id (use MAX(re_review_batch) + 1 from existing)
  3. Find matching entities using build_batch_where_clause()
  4. IMPORTANT: Exclude entities already in active batches:
     ```sql
     AND e.entity_id NOT IN (
       SELECT rec.entity_id FROM re_review_entity_connect rec
       INNER JOIN re_review_assignment ra ON rec.re_review_batch = ra.re_review_batch
       WHERE rec.re_review_approved = 0
     )
     ```
  5. For each matching entity, insert re_review_entity_connect record:
     - Get current status_id and review_id from ndd_entity_view
     - Set re_review_review_saved=0, re_review_status_saved=0, re_review_submitted=0, re_review_approved=0
  6. If assigned_user_id provided, call batch_assign() logic inline
- Log batch creation with entity count
- Return list(status=200, message="Batch created", entry=list(batch_id=X, entity_count=Y))

**Function 4: batch_assign(batch_id, user_id, pool)**
- Verify batch exists and has no existing assignment (is unassigned)
- Insert into re_review_assignment table
- Log assignment
- Return list(status=200, message="Batch assigned")

**Function 5: batch_reassign(batch_id, new_user_id, pool)**
- Verify batch exists
- Update re_review_assignment.user_id for the batch
- Log reassignment
- Return list(status=200, message="Batch reassigned")

**Function 6: batch_archive(batch_id, pool)**
- Soft delete: Delete from re_review_assignment (unassign)
- Note: re_review_entity_connect records preserved for audit
- Log archival
- Return list(status=200, message="Batch archived")

**Important implementation notes from RESEARCH:**
- Use db_execute_query() and db_execute_statement() from db-helpers.R
- All multi-step operations MUST use db_with_transaction()
- gene_list from frontend is array of integers, not comma string
- Use parameterized queries (list of params), never string concatenation

- All functions use db-helpers.R patterns (db_execute_query, db_execute_statement, db_with_transaction)

- Entity overlap prevention query included
- Functions have proper roxygen2 documentation

<task type="auto">
  <name>Task 2: Source re-review-service.R in API startup</name>
  <files>api/start_sysndd_api.R</files>
  <action>
Add source() call for the new service file in api/start_sysndd_api.R.

1. Find the section where other services are sourced (look for "services/" pattern)
2. Add: `source("services/re-review-service.R")`
3. Place it alphabetically with other service sources

This ensures the service functions are available to the endpoints.

  <verify>
```bash
grep -q "re-review-service.R" api/start_sysndd_api.R && echo "Service sourced: OK"
```
  </verify>
  <done>
- re-review-service.R is sourced in API startup
- Service functions available to endpoint handlers
  </done>
