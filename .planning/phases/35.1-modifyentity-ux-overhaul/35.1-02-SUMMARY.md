# Phase 35.1 Plan 02: Modal UX Modernization Summary

**Rich modal headers showing Gene | Disease | Inheritance | Category context, BFormCheckbox switches replacing deprecated CSS, and action button loading states with BSpinner indicators**

## Performance

- **Duration:** 8 min
- **Started:** 2026-01-26T11:45:04Z
- **Completed:** 2026-01-26T11:53:00Z
- **Tasks:** 3
- **Files modified:** 1

## Accomplishments

- All 4 modal headers now display rich entity context: Gene symbol, Disease name, Inheritance mode, Category with stoplight styling
- Replaced all 3 deprecated custom-control-switch CSS patterns with Bootstrap-Vue-Next BFormCheckbox switch prop
- Action buttons now disabled until entity loaded and show BSpinner during their respective submission operations
- Consistent UX across Rename, Deactivate, Modify Review, and Modify Status modals

## Task Commits

Each task was committed atomically:

1. **Task 1: Add submitting state and loading indicators** - `a58e105` (feat)
2. **Task 2: Replace custom-control-switch CSS** - `2e51f72` (refactor)
3. **Task 3: Upgrade modal headers to rich format** - `726b351` (feat)

## Files Created/Modified

- `app/src/views/curate/ModifyEntity.vue` - Enhanced with rich modal headers, modern switches, and loading states

## Decisions Made

- **Unified modal header pattern**: Applied identical rich context pattern to all 4 modals for consistency
- **Submitting state design**: Used nullable string union (`null | 'rename' | 'deactivate' | 'review' | 'status'`) to track which action is submitting
- **Disease name truncation**: Truncate to 200px max-width in headers with full text in tooltip for accessibility
- **Category badge styling**: Reused stoplights_style from colorAndSymbols composable for consistent color coding

## Deviations from Plan

None - plan executed exactly as written.

## Issues Encountered

None - all verifications passed.

## User Setup Required

None - no external service configuration required.

## Next Phase Readiness

- ModifyEntity.vue UX overhaul complete
- All 4 modals have consistent, professional appearance
- Loading states prevent double-submission
- Phase 35.1 (ModifyEntity UX Overhaul) complete
