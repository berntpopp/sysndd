### Key Link Verification

| From | To | Via | Status | Details |
|------|-----|-----|--------|---------|
| ModifyEntity.vue | GeneBadge | component import and usage | WIRED | Import line 755, component registration line 771, usage line 87 |
| ModifyEntity.vue | DiseaseBadge | component import and usage | WIRED | Import line 756, component registration line 772, usage line 98 |
| ModifyEntity.vue | EntityBadge | component import and usage | WIRED | Import line 757, component registration line 773, usage lines 73, 245, 310, 409, 654 (5 uses) |
| ModifyEntity.vue | colorAndSymbols | composable destructuring | WIRED | Import line 752, spread at line 781, template usage `stoplights_style` (5x), `ndd_icon` (1x), `ndd_icon_style` (1x) |

| Action buttons | submitting state | disabled binding and BSpinner | WIRED | `submitting: null` data at line 811, set/clear in all 4 submit methods |

### Requirements Coverage

| Requirement | Status | Notes |
|-------------|--------|-------|
| MEU-01: Entity preview with rich context | SATISFIED | Preview card shows all 5 elements: gene, disease, inheritance, category, NDD status |
| MEU-02: Contextual modal headers | SATISFIED | All 4 modals have Gene/Disease/Inheritance/Category context |
| MEU-03: Modernized form controls | SATISFIED | 3 BFormCheckbox with switch prop, 0 custom-control-switch CSS |
| MEU-04: Action button loading states | SATISFIED | Disabled until loaded, BSpinner during submission |

### Anti-Patterns Found

| File | Line | Pattern | Severity | Impact |
|------|------|---------|----------|--------|
| ModifyEntity.vue | 46, 287, etc. | `placeholder` (in form inputs) | Info | Normal usage - these are input placeholders, not placeholder implementations |

No blocker or warning-level anti-patterns found.

### Human Verification Required

### 1. Visual Entity Preview Test
**Test:** Load ModifyEntity, search for an entity, verify preview card displays correctly
**Expected:** See gene symbol (clickable HGNC link), disease name (clickable ontology link), inheritance with diagram icon, category with stoplight color, NDD status with check/x icon
**Why human:** Visual appearance and link functionality cannot be verified programmatically

### 2. Modal Header Context Test
**Test:** Click each action button (Rename, Deactivate, Modify Review, Modify Status) and inspect modal header
**Expected:** Each modal shows title + entity badge + context row with Gene | Disease | Inheritance | Category badges
**Why human:** Modal rendering and visual layout require human inspection

### 3. Form Switch Functionality Test
**Test:** In Deactivate modal, toggle the "Are you sure" and "Was this entity replaced" switches; in Status modal, toggle "Suggest removal"
**Expected:** Switches toggle smoothly with visual feedback, no Bootstrap 4 custom-control styling
**Why human:** Switch interaction behavior and visual styling require human verification

### 4. Loading State Test
**Test:** Click an action button while no entity loaded, then with entity loaded; observe during submission
**Expected:** Buttons disabled when no entity loaded; during submission, clicked button shows spinner, all buttons disabled
**Why human:** Real-time loading state transitions require human observation
