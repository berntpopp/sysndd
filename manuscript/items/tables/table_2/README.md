# Table 2: Functional Cluster Summary

**Description:**
This table provides a summary of the functional clusters identified through analysis in SysNDD. Each row represents a functional cluster, including information on the number of genes in the cluster, key biological processes or pathways, and examples of genes within each cluster. This highlights the functional relationships and interactions among genes associated with NDDs.

**Detailed Table Content:**
- Cluster ID or Name
- Number of Genes in the Cluster
- Key Biological Processes or Pathways
- Examples of Genes
- Functional Annotations (e.g., GO terms, KEGG pathways)
