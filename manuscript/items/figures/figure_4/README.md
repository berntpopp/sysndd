# Figure 4: Phenotypes and Variation

**Description:**
This figure provides a detailed view of the phenotypic annotations and genetic variations documented in SysNDD. It includes a bar plot showing the frequency of different phenotypes among curated entities, along with examples of specific variations (e.g., de novo mutations, recessive variants) and their associated phenotypes, demonstrating the diversity of phenotypes and genetic variations captured in the database.

**Detailed Figure Content:**
- Bar plot of phenotype frequencies.
- Examples of genetic variations and associated phenotypes.
- Diversity of phenotypes and genetic variations.
