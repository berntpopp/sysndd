# Figure 5: Phenotype and Functional Clustering and Their Correlation

**Description:**
This figure provides a comprehensive visual representation of the results from phenotype and functional clustering analyses. It includes correlograms showing the correlation between different phenotypes, MCA plots demonstrating the clustering of entities based on phenotypic data, and functional clusters of genes with enriched interacting proteins. It highlights the correlation between phenotype clusters and functional gene clusters, illustrating how phenotypic data can inform functional insights.

**Detailed Figure Content:**
- Correlograms of phenotype correlations.
- MCA plots of phenotype clusters.
- Functional gene clusters with enriched interacting proteins.
- Correlation between phenotype and functional clusters.
