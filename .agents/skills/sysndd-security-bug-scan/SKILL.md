description: Use when reviewing or writing SysNDD code for security vulnerabilities or correctness bugs — authorization/role gates, SQL/expression injection, credential and secret handling, data exposure through public or MCP surfaces, resource-exhaustion/DoS from external calls, error/info leakage, and the repo's known R/Plumber footguns — especially before merging a diff or PR

# SysNDD Security & Bug Scan

A focused **defect + vulnerability** review pass over a diff or PR. Distinct from `sysndd-code-quality` (maintainability) — this hunts for exploitable and correctness-breaking defects. It complements the generic `/security-review` and `/code-review` by encoding SysNDD's specific gates, helpers, and footguns.

Core insight: almost every SysNDD vulnerability is **"bypassed a safe helper that already exists."** For each finding, prefer the in-repo helper over a hand-rolled fix.

## Workflow

1. Scope the diff. For each new/changed **endpoint, DB query, external call, or auth path**, run the relevant checks below.
2. Flag any hand-rolled code that a listed helper already covers.
3. Run the guard tests for the touched areas (see Verify) — a failing guard test usually means the change is wrong, not the guard.
4. Report findings by severity with `file:line` and the concrete in-repo fix; separate must-fix from optional.

## Security Checks

### Authorization & privilege escalation
- Every write / admin / curation endpoint must call `require_role(req, res, "<Role>")`. Auth is **per-endpoint** (no global deny filter) — a handler with no gate is reachable **unauthenticated**.
- `direct_approval` escalates the gate to **Curator** server-side; never trust the client flag (re-checked in `svc_status_apply_direct_approval` / `review_apply_direct_approval`). The frontend `hasMinRole` is UX, not a control.
- Attribution is server-set: `status_user_id <- req$user_id`. Never accept `*_user_id` from the request body.

### Injection (SQL / expression / RCE)
- User `filter` / `sort` tokens must pass through `validate_query_column()` via `generate_filter_expressions()` / `generate_sort_expressions()` with `allowed_columns_for_view()`. **Never `paste0()` or raw input into `rlang::parse_exprs()`** — over a dbplyr `tbl` that is SQL injection **and** R-side RCE (local partial-eval runs `system(...)` etc.).
- Parameterize SQL with `?` placeholders + `DBI::dbBind(stmt, unname(params))`. No string-interpolated values.
- URL-encode external path/query segments: `utils::URLencode(x, reserved = TRUE)`.

### Data exposure (public / MCP)
- MCP and public reads are **approved-public only**: reviews gated `is_primary = 1 AND review_approved = 1`; records from `ndd_entity_view` (active only). A query dropping these leaks **draft/unapproved** curation. See `sysndd-mcp-readonly`.
- MCP must not write, generate LLM summaries, or call live external providers.

### Secrets & credentials
- Auth-sensitive inputs (`/auth/signup`, `/auth/authenticate`, password change) are **JSON body only** — never query string (leaks into access/Traefik logs, browser history).
- Log through `sanitize_request()` / `sanitize_object()` (`SENSITIVE_FIELDS` redaction in `core/logging_sanitizer.R`); never log tokens, passwords, or secrets.
- Do not bake `config.yml` / secrets into image layers (no `COPY config.yml` in `api/Dockerfile`; use the runtime mount).
- Passwords use Argon2id/sodium (`hash_password` / `verify_password` in `core/security.R`); never plaintext comparison.

### Resource exhaustion / DoS
- Every external HTTP call derives its timeout/retry from `external_proxy_budget()` or `make_external_request()` — **no hardcoded `req_timeout(<n>)`** (enforced by `test-unit-external-budget-guard.R`). Wrap fetchers in `memoise_external_success_only(source = "<provider>")`.
- Cheap routes (`/health`, `/auth`, `/statistics`) must never call an external fetcher (`test-unit-cheap-route-isolation.R`).
- Public expensive operations are throttled or cache-only (async submit cap; LLM generation is Curator+ only).

### Error / info leakage
- Mount every endpoint sub-router via `mount_endpoint()` (attaches the RFC 9457 `errorHandler` + `notFoundHandler`). A bare `plumber::pr_mount(...)` leaks opaque `500`s with internal detail and drops correct status codes. Throw classed errors (`stop_for_bad_request` / `stop_for_unauthorized` / …), not bare `stop()`.

## Correctness Footguns (SysNDD-specific)

- `DBI::dbBind()` with `?` placeholders needs `unname(params)`; named lists fail silently.
- `dplyr::select` / `filter` are masked (biomaRt/AnnotationDbi) — namespace them explicitly.
- `config::get` masks `base::get` in the loaded API/worker env — bare `get(x, mode = "function")` errors "unused argument (mode)"; use `base::get` or direct dispatch (`test-unit-base-exists-get-guard.R`).
- Plumber returns JSON scalars as arrays — unwrap before feeding back into params.
- Use `inherits(x, "Date")`, not `is.Date()`.
- Worker-executed code is sourced at worker start — a change is not live until the worker restarts.

## Verify

Run the guard tests for the touched areas, then `make lint-api` and the appropriate test lane:

`test-unit-security.R`, `test-unit-filter-column-allowlist.R`, `test-unit-endpoint-error-handler.R`, `test-endpoint-auth.R` / `test-integration-auth.R`, `test-unit-*-endpoint-guard.R`, `test-unit-external-budget-guard.R`, `test-unit-cheap-route-isolation.R`.

Lead with findings ordered by severity, each with `file:line` and the in-repo fix. If nothing is found, say so and list the checks run plus residual risk.
