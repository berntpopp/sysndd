# Constants Folder README

This folder, `src/assets/js/constants`, contains a series of JavaScript files defining various constant values used throughout the project. These constants provide a centralized and consistent way of managing fixed values like URLs, roles, and navigation elements. Below is an overview of each file and its purpose:

## 1. `footer_nav_constants.js`
This file contains constants related to the footer navigation of the application. It defines items that appear in the footer, categorizing them appropriately for easy maintenance and update.

## 2. `init_obj_constants.js`
This file initializes certain objects with default values. These initializations are used in various parts of the application to ensure consistency and to provide a baseline for object states.

## 3. `main_nav_constants.js`
Similar to `footer_nav_constants.js`, this file is focused on the main navigation of the application. It defines the items and structure of the main navigation menu, ensuring a uniform navigation experience across the application.

## 4. `role_constants.js`
This file defines roles and their corresponding access levels within the application. It is crucial for managing user permissions and for implementing role-based access control throughout the app.

## 5. `url_constants.js`
This file consolidates various URLs used in the application, such as links to external resources, APIs, and official websites. It centralizes these URLs to prevent hardcoding them in multiple places, thus facilitating easier updates and maintenance.

Each of these files contributes to the modular and maintainable architecture of the application, allowing for easier updates and consistent usage of these constants across different components and services.
