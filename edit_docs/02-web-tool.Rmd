# Web tool {#web-tool}

---

The SysNDD web tool is available from [https://sysndd.dbmr.unibe.ch/](https://sysndd.dbmr.unibe.ch/) on a server hosted at the Department for BioMedical Research ([DBMR](https://www.dbmr.unibe.ch/)) (University of Bern) and the web address [https://sysndd.org/](https://sysndd.org/) redirects to this server.

The web tool uses the [Vue.js](https://vuejs.org/) (v2.6) JavaScript framework with BootstrapVue to generate a Bootstrap v4 website frontend.


## Landing page

The landing page is designed as simple Bootstrap v4 website with:

1) a navigation menu at the top,
2) the main site content, which changes with navigation to other routes, and
3) a footer navigation bar at the bottom 

Screenshot of the landing page with elements marked:

![Landing page](./static/img/02_01-landing-page.png){max-width=1000px}


The landing page content displays different elemnts to give a quick overview and allow fast navigation:

- a centered search input at the top,
- a box (left side top) with current gene statistics divided by association category and inheritance patterns (Details),
- a box (left side bottom) showing a table of the 5 last entities entered into the database,
- an explanatory text  on the right.


## Main navigation menu

The main navigation allows quick access to all subpages.

The "Tables" button triggers a dropwdown menu with links to:
- "Entities" table view
- "Genes" table view
- "Phenotypes" table view
- "Panels table" view

![Navigation menu tables](./static/img/02_02-navigation-menu-tables.png){max-width=1000px}


The "Analyses" button triggers a dropwdown menu with links to:
- "Compare curations" view
- "Correlate phenotypes" view
- "Entries over time" view
- "NDD Publications" view
- "Functional clusters" view

If not on the landing page the navigation abr also conatins a "Search" button which can show a search field on any page.

If not logged in the right side of the menu shows a button which directs to the Login page.
When logged in as a registered user the menu shows your username and additional links to page views depending on your user rights:

## Footer navigation menu

The footer navigation shows pictures/ logos with links to:

1) the license applied to SysNDD
2) our GitHub repository
3) the SysNDD API view
4) the DFG funder website
5) the website of teh University of Bern hosting our server
6) the ERN-ITHACA website

## Table views

We provide tabular representations with search, filtering, sorting and pagination functionality for different aspects of the entity concept.


### Entities table

The Entities table is intended to provide an overview centered on the entity concept.

![Entities view](./static/img/02_07-sysndd.dbmr.unibe.ch_Entities.png){max-width=1000px}


### Genes table

The Genes table is intended to provide gene centered overview.

![Genes view](./static/img/02_08-sysndd.dbmr.unibe.ch_Genes.png){max-width=1000px}


### Phenotypes table

The Phenotypes table provides the possibility to filter for phenotype combinations annotated to the entities.

![Phenotypes view](./static/img/02_09-sysndd.dbmr.unibe.ch_Phenotypes.png){max-width=1000px}

The "AND/ OR" switch allows the user to change the logik how phenotype combinations are requested:

- AND: only entities having all selected phenoytpes annotated are shown.
- OR: all entities having any of the selected phenoytpes annotated are shown.


### Panels table

The Panels table is intended for users to be able to create lists of NDD-associated genes. Additionally, the columns in the lists can be configured.
Finally, the configuration can be downloaded as Excel file with information on the exact query  in the meta sheet and the requested information in the "data" sheet.
These files can then be used as "virtual panels" to filter genetic variants derived from high-throughput sequencing in external analysis tools.

## Single entry pages

### Entity

### Gene

### Ontology



## Analyses views

### Compare curations

### Correlate phenotypes

### Entries over time

### NDD Publications

### Functional clusters



## About page

The About page contains general information about the project, its creators, funding, updates, and how to find help.



## Login page

The Login page shows a simple form with inputs for the **(1)**  user name and their **(2)**  password,  **(3)** buttons to reset the form and  **(4)** links to registration and password reset.

![Login modal](./static/img/02_16-login-modal.png){max-width=400px}


### Register user page

This page can be used to apply for a SysNDD account by entering following information:

1) desired username
2) institutional E-mail
3) ORCID identifier
4) First name
5) Family name
6) description of your interest in SysNDD and why you want to participate in the curation effort

and **(7)** accepting the terms of use.

The **(8)** buttons allow resetting or submitting the form.

![Register modal](./static/img/02_17-register-modal.png){max-width=400px}

Upon submission the curator status users will receive a mail to review your application. After your application has been confirmed you will receive a mail with your login information and instructions.


### Reset password page

The form on this page allows users who forgot their password to reset this by enetering the E-mail tehy registered with.

![Reset modal](./static/img/02_18-password-reset-modal.png){max-width=400px}

Upon submission the E-mail account will receive a message with a one-time link allowing the user to enter a new password.



## Mobile website

The Vue.js framework enables native cross platform development. Together with the Bootstrap CSS library this enables the SysNDD web app to seamlessly integrate on smaller mobile screens.

![Mobile site](./static/img/02_19-mobile-site.png){max-width=400px}

The layout breaks to mobile view at 768 pixels width and minimizes the navigation and footer menus:

![Mobile navbar](./static/img/02_20-mobile-navbar.png){max-width=400px}

![Mobile footer](./static/img/02_21-mobile-footer.png){max-width=400px}


All tables in mobile views break to a stacked view (column names becoem first column in a cell and values second column) to best use display space:

![Stacked table](./static/img/02_22-mobile-stacked-table.png){max-width=400px}

The table controls and search inputs are further dispalyed at the top in this view.


The analyses pages on mobile pages are best viewed in landscape mode:

![Landscape mode](./static/img/02_23-mobile-analyses-landscape.png){max-width=400px}



## Progressive Web App (PWA)

The SysNDD web app can also be installed on mobile devices using the Progressive Web App ([PWA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Progressive_web_application)) technology.
This is supported in all Chromium-based modern browsers (Chrome, Edge, Opera, etc.) on all common operating systems (Windows, Linux, maxOS and Android).
Additionally new Safari versions on iOS show some support for PWA.

PWAs are faster because they cache files. They offer more screen space for the app. Future integrations of this feature in SysNDD will enable offline use. 

To install the PWA on Android devices follow these steps:

**1)** Visit the SysNDD website at [https://sysndd.dbmr.unibe.ch/](https://sysndd.dbmr.unibe.ch/). You will see a message offering to add the PWA to your home screen:

![PWA add](./static/img/02_24-PWA-install-a.png){max-width=300px}


**2)** After clicking the previous message, confirm the installation by clicking "Install" in the following prompt:

![PWA install](./static/img/02_25-PWA-install-b.png){max-width=300px}


**3)** A message will confirm the installation:

![PWA added](./static/img/02_26-PWA-install-c.png){max-width=300px}


**4)** Following app symbol will be available on one of your screens:

![App symbol](./static/img/02_27-PWA-install-d.png){max-width=300px}


**5)** Clicking this will open SysNDD in PWA mode (no browser adress bar, instead custom colored top bar):

![PWA screenshot](./static/img/02_28-PWA-install-e.png){max-width=300px}



## Performance

Modern Javascript frameworks like Vue.js, which we use for the SysNDD website, offer rich user experience. The generated single-page applications can be slower then server side rendered pages.

With SysNDD we are engaged to provide a fast user experience by reducing component and request sizes and applying techniques like lazy loading and code splitting in the frontend with parallelisation in the api.

A quick overview on the current website performance can be obtained on PageSpeed Insights (or "Lighthouse" in the chrome development console):

## Security

SysNDD is engaged to offer highest security standards for all web tools.
We use HTTPS with Transport Layer Security (TLS) and follow the mozilla recommendations for web server settings. 

A quick overview for our security settings for the SysNDD website can be obtained on Mozilla Oservatory:
