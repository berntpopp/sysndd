# Web tool {#web-tool}

---

The SysNDD web tool is available from [https://sysndd.dbmr.unibe.ch/](https://sysndd.dbmr.unibe.ch/) on a server hosted at the Department for BioMedical Research ([DBMR](https://www.dbmr.unibe.ch/)) (University of Bern) and the web address [https://sysndd.org/](https://sysndd.org/) redirects to this server.

The web tool uses the [Vue.js](https://vuejs.org/) (v2.6) JavaScript framework with BootstrapVue to generate a Bootstrap v4 website frontend.


## Landing page

The landing page is designed as simple Bootstrap v4 website with:

1) a navigation menu at the top,
2) the main site content, which changes with navigation to other routes, and
3) a footer navigation bar at the bottom 

Screenshot of the landing page with elements marked:

![Landing page](./static/img/02_01-landing-page.png){max-width=1000px}


The landing page content displays different elements to give a quick overview and allow fast navigation:

- a centered search input at the top,
- a box (left side top) with current gene statistics divided by association category and inheritance patterns (*Details*),
- a box (left side bottom) showing a table of the five last entities entered into the database,
- an explanatory text  on the right.


## Main navigation menu

The main navigation allows quick access to all sub-pages.

The *Tables* button triggers a dropdown menu with links to:

- *Entities* table view
- *Genes* table view
- *Phenotypes* table view
- *Panels* table view

## Table views

We provide tabular representations with search, filtering, sorting and pagination functionality for different aspects of the entity concept.


### Entities table

The *Entities* table is intended to provide an overview centered on the entity concept.

![Entities view](./static/img/02_07-sysndd.dbmr.unibe.ch_Entities.png){max-width=1000px}


### Genes table

The *Genes* table is intended to provide a gene-centered overview.

![Genes view](./static/img/02_08-sysndd.dbmr.unibe.ch_Genes.png){max-width=1000px}


### Phenotypes table

The *Phenotypes* table provides the possibility to filter for phenotype combinations annotated to the entities.

![Phenotypes view](./static/img/02_09-sysndd.dbmr.unibe.ch_Phenotypes.png){max-width=1000px}

The 'AND/ OR' switch allows the user to change the logic how phenotype combinations are requested:

- AND: only entities having all selected phenotypes annotated are shown
- OR: all entities having any of the selected phenotypes annotated are shown

The *Entities*, *Genes* and *Phenotypes* tables all have the additional two features (top right corner): 

1) Green icon that allows the user to copy the link to the page
2) Yellow icon that allows the use to remove all filters on the table (icon turns blue when all filters are off)

![*Entities*, *Genes* and *Phenotypes* tables - additional features](./static/img/02_09-sysndd.dbmr.unibe.ch2_AdditionalFeatures.png){max-width=1000px}


### Panels table

The *Panels* table is intended for users to be able to create lists of NDD-associated genes. Additionally, the columns in the lists can be configured. Finally, the configuration can be downloaded as an Excel file with information on the exact query in the meta sheet and the requested information in the data sheet. These files can then be used as 'virtual panels' to filter genetic variants derived from high-throughput sequencing in external analysis tools.

![Panels view](./static/img/02_10-sysndd.dbmr.unibe.ch_Panels.png){max-width=1000px}



## Single entry pages

Single entry pages refer to the directed pages associated with each entity, gene or disease ontology. These are accessed clicking on the entity (purple), gene (orange) or disease (green) buttons associated with each entry.   

![Single entry pages](./static/img/02_11-sysndd.dbmr.unibe.ch_SingleEntryPages.png){max-width=1000px}

### Entity

The *Entity* page aims to provide information on the gene, disease (with the OMIM link), inheritance pattern and NDD status associated with a particular entity. The synopsis and phenotypes of the disease as well as the relevant links to publications (including GeneReviews if available) are also provided.    

![Entity page](./static/img/02_12-sysndd.dbmr.unibe.ch_Entity.png){max-width=1000px}


### Gene

The *Gene* page aims to provide further information on 1) the gene of interest with links to other platforms such as Entrez, Ensembl, UCSC, CCDS, UniProt, OMIM gene, MGI, RGD and STRING,  and 2) the entities associated with the gene in a table format.

![Gene page](./static/img/02_13-sysndd.dbmr.unibe.ch_Gene.png){max-width=1000px}

### Ontology

The *Ontology* page aims to provide further information on 1) the inheritance pattern of a disease as well as links to other platforms such as OMIM, DOID, MONDO and Orphanet, and 2) the entities associated with it in a table format. 

![Ontology page](./static/img/02_14-sysndd.dbmr.unibe.ch_Ontology.png){max-width=1000px}

## Analyses views

*Analyses* views are aimed at allowing the use to have a more global picture on comparisons of SysNDD with other curations, phenotype correlations, SysNDD entries over time, NDD publications and functional gene clusters. 


### Compare curations

*Compare curations* view is composed of three tabs: 

1) *Overlap*
2) *Similarity*
3) *Table*


The *Overlap* tab includes an upset plot to show the overlap between SysNDD and other selected NDD curation efforts.  

![Compare curations view: *Overlap* tab](./static/img/02_15-sysndd.dbmr.unibe.ch_CompareCurations1-overlap.png){max-width=1000px}


The *Similarity* tab includes a matrix plot of the cosine similarity between different curation efforts for neurodevelopmental disorders.

![Compare curations view: *Similarity* tab](./static/img/02_15-sysndd.dbmr.unibe.ch_CompareCurations2-similarity.png){max-width=1000px}


The *Table* tab displays a table format to compare the presence of a gene in different curation efforts for neurodevelopmental disorders. This tab has an additional feature that allows the comparison table to be downloaded as an Excel file. The filter removal button is located at the top right corner.

![Compare curations view: *Table* tab](./static/img/02_15-sysndd.dbmr.unibe.ch_CompareCurations3-table.png){max-width=1000px}



### Correlate phenotypes

*Correlate phenotypes* view is composed of three tabs: 

1) *Phenotype correlogram*
2) *Phenotype counts*
3) *Phenotype clustering*


The *Phenotype correlogram* tab displays a matrix of correlations of different phenotypes.

![Correlate phenotypes view: *Phenotype correlogram* tab](./static/img/02_16-sysndd.dbmr.unibe.ch_CorrelatePhenotypes1-PhenotypeCorrelogram.png){max-width=1000px}

## Mobile website

The Vue.js framework enables native cross platform development. Together with the Bootstrap CSS library this enables the SysNDD web app to seamlessly integrate on smaller mobile screens.

![Mobile site](./static/img/02_23-mobile-site.png){max-width=400px}

The layout breaks to mobile view at 768 pixels width and minimizes the navigation and footer menus:

![Mobile navbar](./static/img/02_24-mobile-navbar.png){max-width=400px}

![Mobile footer](./static/img/02_25-mobile-footer.png){max-width=400px}


All tables in mobile views break to a stacked view (column names becoem first column in a cell and values second column) to best use display space:

![Stacked table](./static/img/02_26-mobile-stacked-table.png){max-width=400px}

The table controls and search inputs are further dispalyed at the top in this view.


The analyses pages on mobile pages are best viewed in landscape mode:

![Landscape mode](./static/img/02_27-mobile-analyses-landscape.png){max-width=400px}



## Progressive Web App (PWA)

The SysNDD web app can also be installed on mobile devices using the Progressive Web App ([PWA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Progressive_web_application)) technology.
This is supported in all Chromium-based modern browsers (Chrome, Edge, Opera, etc.) on all common operating systems (Windows, Linux, maxOS and Android).
Additionally new Safari versions on iOS show some support for PWA.

PWAs are faster because they cache files. They offer more screen space for the app. Future integrations of this feature in SysNDD will enable offline use. 

To install the PWA on Android devices follow these steps:

**1)** Visit the SysNDD website at [https://sysndd.dbmr.unibe.ch/](https://sysndd.dbmr.unibe.ch/). You will see a message offering to add the PWA to your home screen:

![PWA add](./static/img/02_28-PWA-install-a.png){max-width=300px}


**2)** After clicking the previous message, confirm the installation by clicking "Install" in the following prompt:

![PWA install](./static/img/02_29-PWA-install-b.png){max-width=300px}


**3)** A message will confirm the installation:

![PWA added](./static/img/02_30-PWA-install-c.png){max-width=300px}


**4)** Following app symbol will be available on one of your screens:

![App symbol](./static/img/02_31-PWA-install-d.png){max-width=300px}


**5)** Clicking this will open SysNDD in PWA mode (no browser adress bar, instead custom colored top bar):

![PWA screenshot](./static/img/02_32-PWA-install-e.png){max-width=300px}



## Performance

Modern Javascript frameworks like Vue.js, which we use for the SysNDD website, offer rich user experience. The generated single-page applications can be slower then server side rendered pages.

With SysNDD we are engaged to provide a fast user experience by reducing component and request sizes and applying techniques like lazy loading and code splitting in the frontend with parallelisation in the api.

A quick overview on the current website performance can be obtained on PageSpeed Insights (or "Lighthouse" in the chrome development console):

[https://pagespeed.web.dev/report?url=https%3A%2F%2Fsysndd.dbmr.unibe.ch%2F](https://pagespeed.web.dev/report?url=https%3A%2F%2Fsysndd.dbmr.unibe.ch%2F&form_factor=desktop)



## Security

SysNDD is engaged to offer highest security standards for all web tools.
We use HTTPS with Transport Layer Security (TLS) and follow the mozilla recommendations for web server settings. 

A quick overview for our security settings for the SysNDD website can be obtained on Mozilla Oservatory:
