# Web tool {#web-tool}

---

The SysNDD web tool is available from [https://sysndd.dbmr.unibe.ch/](https://sysndd.dbmr.unibe.ch/) on a server hosted at the Department for BioMedical Research ([DBMR](https://www.dbmr.unibe.ch/)) (University of Bern) and the web address [https://sysndd.org/](https://sysndd.org/) redirects to this server.
The web tool uses the [Vue.js](https://vuejs.org/) (v2.6) JavaScript framework with BootstrapVue to generate a Bootstrap v4 website frontend.


## Landing page

The landing page is designed as simple Bootstrap v4 website with:

1) a navigation menu at the top,
2) the main site content, which changes with navigation to other routes, and
3) a footer navigation bar at the bottom 

Screenshot of the landing page with elements marked:

![Landing page](./static/img/02_01-landing-page.png){max-width=1000px}


The landing page content displays different elemnts to give a quick overview and allow fast navigation:

- a centered search input at the top,
- a box (left side top) with current gene statistics divided by association category and inheritance patterns (Details),
- a box (left side bottom) showing a table of the 5 last entities entered into the database,
- an explanatory text  on the right.


## Main navigation

The main navigation allows quick access to all subpages.

The "Tables" button triggers a dropwdown menu with links to:
- "Entities" table view
- "Genes" table view
- "Phenotypes" table view
- "Panels table" view

The "Analyses" button triggers a dropwdown menu with links to:
- "Compare curations" view
- "Correlate phenotypes" view
- "Entries over time" view
- "NDD Publications" view
- "Gene networks" view

If not on the landing page the navigation abr also conatins a "Search" button which can show a search field on any page.

If not logged in the right side of the menu shows a button which directs to the Login page.
When logged in as a registered user the menu shows your username and additional links to page views depending on your user rights:

## Footer navigation

The footer navigation shows pictures/ logos with links to:

1) the license applied to SysNDD
2) our GitHub repository
3) the SysNDD API view
4) the DFG funder website
5) the website of teh University of Bern hosting our server
6) the ERN-ITHACA website

## Table views

We provide tabular representations with search, filtering, sorting and pagination functionality for different aspects of the entity concept.


### Entities table

The Entities table is intended to provide an overview centered on the entity concept.

### Genes table

The Genes table is intended to provide gene centered overview.

### Phenotypes table

The Phenotypes table provides the possibility to filter for phenotype combinations annotated to the entities.

![Phenotypes view](./static/img/02_09-sysndd.dbmr.unibe.ch_Phenotypes.png){max-width=1000px}

The "AND/ OR" switch allows the user to change the logik how phenotype combinations are requested:

- AND: only entities having all selected phenoytpes annotated are shown.
- OR: all entities having any of the selected phenoytpes annotated are shown.


### Panels table

The Panels table is intended for users to be able to create lists of NDD-associated genes. Additionally, the columns in the lists can be configured.
Finally, the configuration can be downloaded as Excel file with information on the exact query  in the meta sheet and the requested information in the "data" sheet.
These files can then be used as "virtual panels" to filter genetic variants derived from high-throughput sequencing in external analysis tools.

## About page

The About page contains general information about the project, its creators, funding, updates, and how to find help.



## Login page

The Login page shows a simple form with inputs for the **(1)**  user name and their **(2)**  password,  **(3)** buttons to reset the form and  **(4)** links to registration and password reset.

1) desired username
2) institutional E-mail
3) ORCID identifier
4) First name
5) Family name
6) description of your interest in SysNDD and why you want to participate in the curation effort

and **(7)** accepting the terms of use.

The **(8)** buttons allow resetting or submitting the form.
