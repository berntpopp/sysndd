# Development Overrides - Auto-loaded by Docker Compose
#
# This file is automatically merged with docker-compose.yml when running:
#   docker compose up
#
# For production (skip overrides):
#   docker compose -f docker-compose.yml up
#
# What this enables:
# - Hot-reload development for frontend (Dockerfile.dev + Compose Watch)
# - MySQL port exposed at localhost:7654 for database tools
# - Development environment settings

services:
  # DEV-03: Database access for local tools
  # Connect with DBeaver, MySQL Workbench, DataGrip, etc.
  mysql:
    ports:
      # Bind to localhost only (not network-accessible for security)
      - "127.0.0.1:7654:3306"

  # DEV-02: API development mode
  # Note: Compose Watch for API is configured in docker-compose.yml
  # because the API Dockerfile serves both dev and prod
